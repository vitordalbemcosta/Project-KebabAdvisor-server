# Project-KebabAdvisor-server

MERN Web Application (MongoDB, Express.js, React and Node.js).

Developed a Full-Stack single page application with MERN Stack ( MongoDB, Express JS, React and Node JS ) Application built from start to finish with both back end server (deployed with Mongo ATLAS) and the front end (deployed with Netlify). I built an API with MongoDB and Postman. I used Mongoose for models and database communication. The application has a sign up, log in and log out functionality.
